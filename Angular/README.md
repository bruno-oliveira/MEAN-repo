# AngularJS
Recently v2 was released, and it simplifies the cognitive model of Angular v1 to have less concepts, while maintaining the same functionality.

An AngularJS app is a tree of components and components are how we reason about our UI.

- A component controller

Additionally, we might need to import extra things we will need to use in the component.
