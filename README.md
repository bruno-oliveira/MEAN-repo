# MEAN-repo
A repo that displays use-cases, exercises and references full-stack apps done with the MEAN stack.

## Basic structure and repo idea
The idea is to both gather resources and display sample **reusable** components on each one of the letters that comprise the full-stack framework, MEAN.
While these components need not to be single, standalone components, they must be devised in a way that they can be seamlessly integrated in any existing web application. A list of such components will be created and updated, both here and on each of the README files inside each one of the folders. The idea is a recurrent one in web development: scaffold as much as possible, to code as little as possible.

### To-Do list
Each item on this to-do list, must provide:
* A reusable component, in any way
* Easy integration within an existing code base

The list is as follows:

1. Login functionality, both with landing login page and a configured database to handle user creating and authentication (E and M as main components)
2. API consumption and display in the front-end (A as main component)
3. Database schemas and CRUD operation views (M, E, A and N as main components)
4. DB look-up tables display (A as main component)
5. Sending emails
6. Search and filter functionalities within an app, for DB searches for eg (A and N and M as main components)
7. Sample boilerplate app, created via Expres-Generator that glues all of the above together.

#### Possible examples of boilerplate apps:
