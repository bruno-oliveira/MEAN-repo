# MEAN-repo
A repo that displays use-cases, exercises and references full-stack apps done with the MEAN stack.

## Basic structure and repo idea
The idea is to both gather resources and display sample **reusable** components on each one of the letters that comprise the full-stack framework, MEAN.
While these components need not to be single, standalone components, they must be devised in a way that they can be seamlessly integrated in any existing web application. A list of such components will be created and updated, both here and on each of the README files inside each one of the folders. The idea is a recurrent one in web development: scaffold as much as possible, to code as little as possible.
